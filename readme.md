**DESCRIPTION:** The inspiration for this assignment came from *The Odin Project: JavaScript Web Development* [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript#assignment).

**OBJECTIVE:** The purpose of this project was to build a Tic Tac Toe game with two modes - 2 human players or 1 human player against the computer.  The game defaults to 2-human players, but allows the user to click 'Change Mode' at any time to toggle between modes.  When this happens, the game will reset and start over in the desired mode.  

The game will present a modal when the game is over along with a message of whether the game ended in a tie or a win.  If there was a win, that player's score will be increased by one and the 3 squares that won will be highlighted.  Upon closing the modal, the game will continue on to another around, starting with the next player in turn order.  

The computer player is a very simple AI where it chooses a random empty square and then uses a simulated DOM click on the chosen square.  Async/Await is also used to give a slight delay to when the computer takes its turn.  , 

It is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  The layout is achieved using both CSS Grid and Flexbox.

A live demo of this app can be viewed [here](https://larissagrayson.github.io/TicTacToe-App/).
